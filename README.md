# Relations

An Elixir helper package to define relations and corresponding property tests

TODO : maybe change name ?? category if we get category to replace `module` with extra semantics ??

the main macro defined here are :
- defeq to define an equivalence relation,
- defrel to define a relation (function with two arguments) with the properties it must satisfy,
- reltest to test properties of a relation when running `mix test`.
